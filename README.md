# onibotoke

> 鬼仏 (onibotoke)，lit. "Demonic Buddha"

A no-nonsense fuzzy project search tool. Like
[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), but specifically for jumping
to projects.

Named after the onibotoke (Sculptor's Idols) in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, that
allow you to fast travel around the map.
